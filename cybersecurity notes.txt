2) Getting started with Networking
-----------------------

Things to know:
1. IP address
2. Subnet Masks
3. Gateway
4. DNS
5. Network Switch
6. Network Router
7. What are "Access points'
8. MAC address
9. What are "Ports" in network addressing
10. Types of networks (WAN, LAN, PAN, MAN, VPN)

-----------------------

1.	An IP address is a unique Identifier that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. It stands for Internet Protocol, and it is used for communication.

2.	A subnet mask is a 32-bit number that divides an IP address into a host address and a network address. It helps to filter which devices can communicate with each other on a network.

3.	A gateway is typically a device or a node that connects networks and allows them to communicate by translating protocols and data formats.

4.	The DNS is used for translating internet address to numeric machine addresses that computers understand and use.

5.	A network switch is a hardware component used to connect networks by using packet switching to receive and forward data. Packet switching is when a message is broken into parts and sent in those parts one by one.

6.	A network router is a device that connects two or more packet switched networks. It helps to manage traffic between networks and allow different devices to use the same internet connection.

7.	Access points are hubs that allow multiple devices to connect with each other.

8.	Media access control addresses (MAC address) are used to identify which device is which on a network so the data being sent to one device doesn’t get sent to another.

9.	A port address is used for identifying an application on a device that uses the internet for communication

10.	A LAN is a network that is limited to a small area, including a building or a home.
	A WAN is a network that is a much larger area and connects LANs and other networks together.
	A PAN is a network for individual device within the rage of an individual person
	A MAN is a network that is in between the radius of LAN and WAN, usually the size of cities. 
	A VPN is used to create a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network including the internet.
Information gets sent over networks in Packets, made up of binary.

5. Memory types

1. CPU (central processing unit) executes sequences of stored instructions called programs
2. Memory: Registers, Cache memory, RAM, ROM, secondary storage, virtual memory, Tertiary Storage
Registers: Tiny storage areas within the CPU itself
	Function: store data that the CPU needs imminently, ensuring ultra-fast access
	size: limited, holds immediate data for current operations
	speed: fastest memory type due to being inside the cpu
Cache memory: a small-sized volatile computer memory that provides high-speed data access to the processor
	Levels:
		L1 Cache: Located directly on the processer (CPU). smallest but fastest
		L2 Cache: Larger than L1, may be on the CPU or near it on the same chip
		L3 Cache: Even larger, slightly slower, typically shared across all CPU cores
		Function: stores data that has been accessed alot, enhancing the speed and performance of it.
RAM (Random Access Memory) Volitile memory, serves as the computer's "working memory". basically stores information that is currently being used.
Definition: Volatile memory, servers as the computer's "working memory."
types: 
	DRAM (Dynamic RAM): most common type but needs to be refreshed constantly
aliayanahil@gmail.com	SRAM (Static RAM): Faster, but less common. doesnt need to be refreshed. often used for cache memory.
Function: Stores data for active tasks, enabling quick read and write access.
Speed: Slower than cache but faster than storage devices. crucial for smooth system operations

ROM (Read-Only Memory)
Definition: Non-volatile memory, cannot be easily altered or reprogrammed.
Types:
	Prom (programmable ROM): can only be programmed once
	EPROM (Erasable PROM): Can be erased with UV light and reprogrammed.
	EEPROM (electrically EPROM): can be electrically erased and reprogrammed
Function: stores firmware or data that needs to remain intact even when system is shut off.

Secondary Storage (Mass Storage)
Definition: Non-volatile emory systems for long-term storage
Types:
	SSD (Solid State Drive): uses NAND-based flash memory (able to stay without power source). it has no moving parts and faster than HDDs
	HDD (Hard Disk Drive): Uses magnetic storage with mechanical parts. it has a larger capacity for its price but is s;pw than SSDs
	Optical Drives (CD, DVD, Blu-ray): uses lasers to read/write data
	Flash Drives: Portable Storage, use flash memory similar to SSDs
Function: Store large amounts of data permanently, including the operating systems, apps, and other files from the user
Speed: generally slower than RAM, but newer versions of SSd's can be close in speeds for certain operations

Virtual Memory
Definition: A memory management capability that uses a combination of RAM and disk space to enable larger programs to run  within the avalible physical memory
Function: when RAM gets full, data that isnt used muc is "paged out" to a designated space on the storage drive called the "swap space" or "page file" to make more RAM for the space-hungry operation
Speed: Access speed is determined by the storage medium (SSDs will provide faster virtual memory access than HDDs)

Tertiary Storage: Data storage solutions like tape drives
Function: used for archiving or backing up vast amounts of data.
Speed: much slower, is better suited for data that isn't often used

Volatile:
RAM, Cache

Persistent:
HDD, SSD, Optic CD DVD Blue-ray, Flash drives, Memory cards

Layers of OS:
OS: makes sure programs are running smoothly, controls the hardware and others. Manages everything.
File Systems: Used for storing the user’s documents.
Shell: takes commands (typing, clicking) and tells the operating system on what to translate
Kernal: Computer’s coordinator. It keeps track and manages how applications or programs use the hardware.
BIOS: Prepares everything when you provide power to computer, so it can start running.
Firmware: software embedded in hardware devices to make them work correctly
Hardware

CPU: central component of a PC that executes instructions from a computer program performing operations. Brain of the computer
HDD, SSD  (memory): A HDD uses magnets tis tire and retrieve digital information with the read/write heads. An SSD uses a NAND-based flash memory with no moving parts
RAM: RAM is used to store data that is actively being processed. RAM is a volatile memory, meaning it gets emptied once power is cut off.
Motherboard: main circuit board of a computer and it houses the RAM, CPU, and other essentials providing connections between them.
Case: houses all the hardware in the PC
Power supply: converts electrical power into a form that computers can use.

8. internet and network
Internet: a series of devices connection to eachother
Ip (internet protocol) : unique identifier for devices on a network
Ipv4: 4 billion addresses
Ipv6: 300 trillion addresses

Bit – byte – kilobyte – megabyte – gigabyte- terabyte - petabyte

TCP: need acknowledgement, response when sending info. Cannot get mixed up because response is given.
UDP: no response. Sends information, hopes someone gets it. Can get mixed up.

Network appliance: hardware used for performing specific functions within a computer network.
Switch: connects device to a local network to send information only where it needs to go, reducing network traffic, traffic cop for computer network.
Router: like switches but works for the internet. Instead of only sending info from device to device, it sends it between device and internet. Uses Ip addresses to find the best path of travel.
Wireless router: same as router but lets devices connect without cables through Wi-Fi. All wireless routers are routers but not all routers are wireless routers.

Bash Scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is a Bash Script?

A Bash script is a file that contains a series of commands writtin for
the bash interpreter. bash (bourne Again SHell) is a popular command-line
interface (CLI) for linux distributions and Mac-OS. these scripts automate
tasks by allowing the users to perform multiple commands in one go, saving
time and reducing the chance for manual errors.

What are its uses in linux?

	1. Automation of Repetitive Tasks

Backup scripts - Automating the process of backing up files or directories
Scheduled tasks: Using cron jobs to execute scripts at intervals (eg. daily
or weekly maintenance tasks)
System updates: Automating system updates and patches by script package
management commands.

customize user environments, like setting aliases, environment variables, or
functions.
Startup scripts: Running specific tasks at system boot, such as starting custom 
services or performing system health checks.

	9. Data and Text Processing

Parsing logs: Automating the extraction of useful information from log files,
such as error detection.
Generating reports: Combining and summarizing data from multiple files, then
formatting and reporting the results.

	How to write a simple bash script
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#!/bin/bash

number = 2

if [ $number == 2]; then
	echo "the number is 2"
else
	echo "the number is not 2"
fi


this script has a declared variable. the variable is "number" and its declared
with "2".

the control structer is an if-statement. the if statement states if the variable
"number" equals 2, then say "the number is 2". then there is the else command.
if the condition in the parameters is not true, then the else statement will
execute. the example here is "the number is not 2" will show up.
